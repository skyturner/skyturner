## I'm Sky Turner, an alter in the system named "Isabelle Azim Munnee".

I spend a lot of my time coding; mainly working for Ike - another alter with a company, and on projects to help manage Dissociative Identity Disorder.
I do like coding in general though so occasionally if I find time I'll make whatever grabs my attention!

I'm proficient in react.js and AWS, spending most of my time working on cloud infastructure (front/back)-ends, 
but I like to tackle problems in almost everything - apart from maybe Lisp or COBOL x3

Since I share this lifespan with 30 odd others, I don't have a whole lot of the aforementioned time xP.
I tend to spend my time away from work on composition of both music and food! I also love stargazing and watching the sun rise.
